// Awesome! Let's start **Syllogism** — one of the most asked reasoning topics in **IB ACIO** and other govt exams.

// ---

// ## 🧠 **SYLLOGISM – From Basic to IB Level**

// ---

// ### 🔍 **What is a Syllogism?**

// Syllogism is a type of logical reasoning where you are given **two or more statements**, and based on those, you must decide which **conclusions** logically follow.

// ---

// ### 🧩 **Basic Structure**

// 1. **Statement(s):** General facts or assumptions
// 2. **Conclusion(s):** You must determine whether they follow **logically**.

// ---

// ### 📚 **Standard Statements Types**:

// | Statement Type   | Example                 | Meaning                       |
// | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
// | All A are B      | All dogs are animals    | Every dog is an animal        |
// | Some A are B     | Some cats are black     | At least one cat is black     |
// | No A is B        | No bird is a cat        | Zero birds are cats           |
// | Some A are not B | Some apples are not red | At least one apple is not red |

// ---

// ### ✅ **Golden Rules to Remember**

// 1. **“All A are B”** → does **NOT** mean **All B are A**

//    * E.g., All dogs are animals ≠ All animals are dogs

// 2. **“Some”** = Minimum one (can be more)

// 3. **Negative statements** (like *No*, *Some not*) are **never assumed** unless clearly stated.

// 4. **Reversing "Some" is valid**:

//    * Some A are B → Some B are A ✅

// 5. **Reversing "All" or "No" is NOT valid**

//    * All A are B → All B are A ❌

// ---

// ## 🧠 Example:

// **Statements:**
// All apples are fruits.
// Some fruits are sweet.

// **Conclusion 1:** Some apples are sweet. ❌ (Can't say)
// **Conclusion 2:** Some fruits are apples. ✅
// Only **2 follows**

// ---

// ## ✅ Now Practice Time – **IB ACIO Level Syllogism Set 1**

// All pens are books.
// All books are papers.

// **Conclusions:**

// 1. All pens are papers.
// 2. Some papers are pens.

// a) Only 1 follows
// b) Only 2 follows
// c) Both follow
// d) Neither follows

// ---

// ### **Q2.**

// All dogs are animals.

// **Conclusions:**

// 1. Some cats are animals.
// 2. All animals are cats.

// a) Only 1 follows
// b) Only 2 follows
// c) Both follow
// d) Neither follows

// ---

// ### **Q3.**

// **Statements:**
// No apple is banana.
// All bananas are fruits.

// **Conclusions:**

// 1. No apple is fruit.
// 2. Some fruits are not apples.

// a) Only 1 follows
// b) Only 2 follows
// c) Both follow
// d) Neither follows

// ---

// ### **Q4.**

// **Conclusions:**

// 1. Some books are poems.
// 2. All poems are books.

// a) Only 1 follows
// b) Only 2 follows
// c) Both follow
// d) Neither follows

// ---

// ### **Q5.**

// **Statements:**
// Some A are B.
// All B are C.

// **Conclusions:**

// 1. Some A are C.
// 2. All A are C.

// a) Only 1 follows
// b) Only 2 follows
// c) Both follow
// d) Neither follows

### 📘 1. **4 Standard Types of Statements**

| Statement Type   | Symbol | Meaning                         |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| All A are B      | A → B  | Every A is inside B             |
| Some A are B     | A ⊂⊃ B | At least one A is B             |
| No A is B        | A ⊄ B  | Zero overlap between A and B    |
| Some A are not B | A ≠ B  | Some A are definitely **not** B |

---

### 📗 2. **Golden Rules of Conclusion**

| Given        | Conclusion   | Valid?         | Example                                  |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| All A are B  | Some B are A | ❌ (Not always) | All pens are books ≠ some books are pens |
| Some A are B | Some B are A | ✅              | True in both directions                  |
| No A is B    | No B is A    | ✅              | Valid reverse                            |
| All A are B  | All B are A  | ❌              | Not reversible                           |

---

### ✅ 3. **Valid Deductions Table**

| Statements Given            | What can be concluded?     |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| All A are B + All B are C   | All A are C ✅              |
| Some A are B + All B are C  | **No direct** conclusion ❌ |
| All A are B + No B is C     | No A is C ✅                |
| Some A are B + Some B are C | No direct conclusion ❌     |
| No A is B + All B are C     | No A is C ✅                |

---

### 🚫 4. **Invalid Traps to Avoid**

| Trap                     | Example                                         | Why It’s Wrong             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Assuming reverse         | All apples are fruits → All fruits are apples ❌ | Direction matters          |
| Mixing “some” with “all” | Some cats are dogs → All cats are dogs ❌        | “Some” doesn’t mean “all”  |
| Guessing from real life  | Dog is an animal → So all animals are dogs ❌    | Stick to logic in question |

---

### 🟦 5. **Super Quick Decision Guide**

| Conclusion Type  | When It’s Valid               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| All A are B      | Only if A → B fully connected |
| Some A are B     | Only if stated or reversible  |
| No A is B        | Only if clearly stated        |
| Some A are not B | Only if clearly stated        |

---

### 💡 **Pro Tip:**

When in doubt, draw quick **mental circles**:

* “All A are B” → small circle inside big one
* “No A is B” → two circles not touching
* “Some A are B” → overlapping circles
