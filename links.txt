Great question — and solid decision! Learning GSAP + Three.js (or React Three Fiber) together can open doors to building awesome 3D interactive websites, portfolios, or even mini-games. Here's a realistic, no-fluff timeline based on your current React/JS knowledge:
🧠 Assumptions

    You're already familiar with JavaScript, React, and have experience building projects.

    You're working on this part-time (after internship hours or weekends).

    You’re consistent — spending 1.5 to 2 hours/day.

📅 Realistic Timeline to Learn GSAP + Three.js / R3F
🔹 Week 1–2: Learn GSAP Basics (Animations Mastery)

    Tween, Timeline, Stagger, Easing

    Animate DOM, SVG, and Canvas

    ScrollTrigger basics (scroll-based animation)

    Projects:

        UI card animation

        Scroll-triggered section reveal

✅ By end of week 2, you’ll confidently animate web UIs and know GSAP inside out.
🔹 Week 3–6: Learn Three.js Fundamentals

    WebGL context, Scene, Camera, Renderer

    3D Object (mesh), Geometry, Material, Light

    Loading 3D models (.glb/.gltf)

    Controls (OrbitControls), shadows, animations

    Projects:

        Rotating 3D cube

        Load a 3D model and interact with it

        Animate 3D objects using GSAP

✅ After 4 weeks, you’ll be comfortable rendering and controlling 3D scenes.
🔹 Week 7–8: Integrate GSAP with Three.js

    Animate camera, object position/rotation with GSAP

    Create Scroll-based 3D animations

    Project:

        Scroll-based 3D portfolio (like Apple product reveal style)

✅ By now, you’ve connected GSAP + Three.js into one clean flow.
🔹 Week 9–10: Optional → React Three Fiber (if you're React lover 💙)

    Convert Three.js code to JSX with @react-three/fiber

    Use @react-three/drei for helper components

    Animate with GSAP or @react-spring/three

    Projects:

        Animated 3D portfolio in React

        R3F + GSAP hybrid

🕒 Total Time Needed (Estimated)
Track	Time Needed
GSAP only	2 weeks
Three.js only	4 weeks
GSAP + Three.js	6–8 weeks
GSAP + React Three Fiber	8–10 weeks

    ⚠️ If you go slow or skip days, this can stretch to 3 months. But with consistency, 2 months is very doable.

📚 Resources You’ll Need
GSAP:

    greensock.com/learning

    YouTube: "GSAP Animation Crash Course" by Online Tutorials, Kevin Powell, etc.

Three.js:

    threejs.org/docs

    YouTube: Three.js Journey (paid, but 🔥), or free ones by Nik Lever, Fireship, etc.

    DiscoverThreeJS.com

React Three Fiber:

    docs.pmnd.rs

    YouTube: Bruno Simon's React Three Fiber Crash Course

✅ Final Advice

    Start with GSAP first — it builds confidence, fun, and you'll reuse it with Three.js anyway.

    Then dive into Three.js.

    Once you're good there, React Three Fiber is just a cleaner, React-style wrapper for everything.
