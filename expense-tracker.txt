## **📌 Smart Expense & Budget Tracker (with AI Insights)**

### **Problem it solves (real-world):**

* People struggle to **track daily expenses**, control overspending, and plan savings.
* Current apps are either too complex, require subscriptions, or don’t give **personalized insights**.

---

### **Core Features (MVP):**

1. **Add Expenses & Income**

   * Manual entry with categories (Food, Rent, Travel, etc.)
   * CSV upload (bank statements, PayTM, GPay export).

2. **Search + Filters (with Debounce)**

   * Quickly find past expenses by name, date, or category.

3. **Smart Dashboard**

   * Monthly spending summary with **charts & graphs** (Recharts / Chart.js).
   * Budget vs. Actual visualization.

4. **Local Storage + Sync**

   * Start with LocalStorage for persistence.
   * Later, connect to Firebase / Supabase for cloud sync.

---

### **Advanced Features (Phase 2):**

1. **AI-Powered Spending Insights**

   * Use a small AI/ML model or simple rules:

     * “⚠️ You spent 40% more on Food this month compared to last month.”
     * “💡 You could save ₹5,000/month if you cut down daily coffee.”

2. **Bill Reminder + Notifications**

   * Get alerts for rent, EMI, or subscription renewals.

3. **Export & Share**

   * Export monthly report as **PDF/CSV**.
   * Share with family/roommates.

4. **Gamification**

   * Achievements like “5 Days Without Ordering Food 🍔” or “Saved ₹10,000 in a Month 🎉”.

### **Tech Stack You Can Use:**

* **Frontend:** React + Tailwind + Recharts/Chart.js
* **Backend (optional at MVP stage):** Firebase / Supabase
* **Storage:** LocalStorage → IndexedDB → Cloud sync
