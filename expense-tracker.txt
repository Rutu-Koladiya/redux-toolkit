Smart Expense & Budget Tracker (with AI Insights)

Problem it solves (real-world):

*People struggle to track daily expenses, control overspending, and plan savings.
Current apps are either too complex, require subscriptions, or don’t give *personalized insights.

Core Features (MVP):

1. Add Expenses & Income

   Manual entry with categories (Food, Rent, Travel, etc.)
   CSV upload (bank statements, PayTM, GPay export).

2. Search + Filters (with Debounce)

   Quickly find past expenses by name, date, or category.

3. Smart Dashboard

   Monthly spending summary with charts & graphs (Recharts / Chart.js).
   Budget vs. Actual visualization.

4. Local Storage + Sync

   Start with LocalStorage for persistence.
   Later, connect to Firebase / Supabase for cloud sync.

Advanced Features (Phase 2):

1. AI-Powered Spending Insights

   Use a small AI/ML model or simple rules:

     “⚠️ You spent 40% more on Food this month compared to last month.”
     “💡 You could save ₹5,000/month if you cut down daily coffee.”

2. Bill Reminder + Notifications

   Get alerts for rent, EMI, or subscription renewals.

3. Export & Share

   Export monthly report as PDF/CSV.
   Share with family/roommates.

4. Gamification*

   Achievements like “5 Days Without Ordering Food 🍔” or “Saved ₹10,000 in a Month 🎉”.

Tech Stack You Can Use:*

Frontend: React + Tailwind + Recharts/Chart.js
Backend (optional at MVP stage): Firebase / Supabase
Storage: LocalStorage → IndexedDB → Cloud sync
AI Insights (optional add-on): OpenAI API / simple rules engine

Why this project is strong?

Solves a real-world problem (everyone struggles with money tracking 💸).
Scalable — start small (React + LocalStorage) and grow (AI + Cloud).
Great for your portfolio (dashboard, charts, CRUD, search, filters, debounce, export).
If you polish it, you could even launch it as a free tool/app.
