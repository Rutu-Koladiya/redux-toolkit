## **🍱 Healthy Meal Kit Optimizer (Local Market Based)**

### **The Problem**

* Fitness apps & chatbots can tell you “eat 120g protein, 50g carbs…” but people still **struggle to make meals** from real ingredients they can afford.
* Meal kit services (Zomato Pro, HelloFresh, etc.) exist, but they are **expensive**, not localized, and not tailored to **individual nutrition + budget + local availability**.

### **Your Unique Solution**

👉 Build a **Healthy Meal Kit Optimizer Web App** that:

1. Takes user input:

   * Diet preference (Veg/Non-Veg/Vegan).
   * Budget per week (₹2000, ₹5000, etc.).
   * Fitness goal (Lose Weight, Gain Muscle, Maintain).
   * Allergies/avoidances (e.g., lactose, peanuts).

2. Generates a **personalized weekly meal plan** with:

   * Recipes using **locally available ingredients** (not exotic/expensive ones).
   * Exact **grocery shopping list** auto-generated (so they don’t overbuy).

3. **Income Stream (Unique Point):**

   * **Affiliate model:** Connect with local grocery delivery apps (Blinkit, BigBasket, Instamart) → one-click “Buy Ingredients” → you get commission.
   * **Freemium model:**

     * Free: Basic weekly plans.
     * Paid: Advanced features (macro tracking, AI substitution, export meal kit PDF, integration with gym trainers).

### **Why It’s Unique?**

✅ ChatGPT (or me 😅) can suggest recipes, but won’t:

* Stick to **your local grocery prices & availability**.
* Balance **budget + health + taste** in a structured weekly plan.
* Give you a **buy button → cart full of exact ingredients**.

This makes your app **a bridge between health apps + grocery e-commerce** → nobody is combining them properly right now in the Indian/local market context.

  * Nutrition APIs (Edamam/Spoonacular).
